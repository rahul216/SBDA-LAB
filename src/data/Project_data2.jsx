parasite operates in a host cell, the metabolites required for the organism's survival and proliferation, and the essential genes that are needed for the cell to remain
pathogenic and virulent. Our next step would be to utilize the reconstructed model's predictions to identify potential biomarkers or therapeutic drug targets to improve
on existing drug delivery systems.`,

understanding of cancer. A variety of methods can be used to predict how different transcriptional modifications are translated into alterations in protein-encoding
genes, their functions and how these altered genes/proteins interact with other biologically active compounds, leading to the formation and progression of malignant
