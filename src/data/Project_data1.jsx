      "Artificial Intelligence to improve current In-vitro Fertilization methodologies (Funded by DBT-2020)",
    text: "Even though recent technological evolution in assisted reproduction has resulted in several new advances in In Vitro Fertilization procedure, the live birth rate remains comparatively low. With the aim of reducing socio-economic burden from the infertile couple, we intend to use artificially intelligence to provide more explainable and reliable solutions in the field of reproductive health and will assist the clinicians in decision making. This research study might be the very beginning of personalized prediction system that is specifically designed for Indian population.",

    heading: "Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence to study infertility",
    text: "A recent report suggests that approximately 48 million couples worldwide and 1 in 4 couples in developing countries experience infertility due to many distinct medical problems and lifestyle behaviors, as well as an unknown combination of them. We aim to predict and perform the accurate identification of causes of infertility and the underling networks of molecular entities using complex network construction, machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence. This study can help unraveling unknown causes of infertility, provide therapeutic targets for restoring fertility and contribute towards current assisted reproductive techniques.",

      "Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence to study human preimplantation embryo development",
    text: `Preimplantation embryonic development (PED) of mammals covers the period from fertilization to
     implantation in the endometrium. However, species-specific differences like genome activation, the gene 
     expression patterns, chromosome frequency poor segregation and patterns of epigenetic modifications can 
     limit the extrapolation of some discoveries to the human preimplantation embryo development. Our goal is 
     to shed more light on the complex effects about the functional pathways and underlying mechanisms of these
      molecular events and to provide a clearer understanding of human pre-implantation development at cellular
       and molecular resolution for prediction, using ML/AI approaches.`,

    text: `Embryo implantation failure is one of the major causes of infertility which is affected by both the quality of the embryo, and characteristics of the endometrium. Using
Transcriptomics, we intend to make significant contributions towards diagnosing the underlying reasons behind infertility caused due to endometrium characteristics
accurately. This study could help the couples enduring unexplained infertility to undergo successful embryo implantation and conceive a child with or without IVF,
especially in developing country like ours. `,

    heading: `Metagenomics to understand the contribution of vaginal microbiome to host's reproductive health`,
    text: `Since the vaginal microbiome functions as preliminary defence against infections and dangerous pathogens that may invade the female reproductive tract, any
fluctuation or vaginal microbial dysbiosis can lead to severe infections, disorders, and pregnancy related complications such as Pre-Term Births, Preeclampsia, etc.
Using metagenomics methods and methodologies, our goal is to acquire a better understanding of the association and correlation between the vaginal microbiome
and the reproductive health of the host, and the underlying processes that lead to microbial dysbiosis and related disorders. This study can help clinicians make
predictions about infections or pregnancy related complications that a woman might go through based on the composition of her vaginal microbiome.`,
